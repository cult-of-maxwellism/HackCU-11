First, ask if it's preventative or diagnostic.

If preventative:
    before starting:
        check fluids 
            if low: fill
            if antifreeze/coolant is low, warn user to wait until engine is cold to fill fluids
        inspect tires (for tread depth, wear, visible cracks, visible metal/missing chunks)
            if chunks are missing, large holes are present, or tread has less than 1mm of depth, recommend not driving and purchasing new tires
        check brake pads (shove a straw into brakes until you hit the pads, then mark the straw and measure depth)
            subtract .2 inches from measurement, and
                if remaining measurement is less than 1/4th inch, replace soon.
                If remaining is less than 1/8th inch, recommend not driving and replacing immediately.
        



First, check functionality:
    Is item present (if visible)?
    If you attempt to start the vehicle, does the vehicle start?
